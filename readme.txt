Issues and improvements:

1. When I first copy the html code from oneUI I found the glyphicons not working as expected, not all of them, just the social ones like si-xxx. I cost time in fixing this. Because you need to find a path to include these fonts so I put all these files in public folder and include them in main.css file.

2. For this application I just put all the code I want to include in the imports folder and import these files in my main.js file. I think there might be a better way to organize the files. I choose this way because it seperate my code and default files well.

3.In this project I didn't use meteor or npm packages and I just include jquery and bootstrap by the files oneUI provided me because they work fine for me. I may use the packages when I build large projects.
